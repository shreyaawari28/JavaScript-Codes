# JavaScript Conditional Statements – Example Program

This repository contains a basic JavaScript program that demonstrates the use of **conditional statements** in JavaScript.  
It is intended for beginners to understand how decisions are made in programs using conditions.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program demonstrates different types of conditional statements used in JavaScript, including:

- `if` statement
- `if-else` statement
- `else if` ladder

It shows how program flow changes based on conditions and how values are assigned accordingly.

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Declares variables to represent mode and background color
- Uses the `if` statement to check a condition and assign a value
- Uses `if-else` to handle two possible conditions
- Uses `else if` ladder to handle multiple conditions
- Assigns background color values based on the current mode
- Prints outputs to the browser console using `console.log()`

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
