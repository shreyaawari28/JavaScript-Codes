# Practice Question – Average Marks of Class

This repository contains a simple JavaScript program that calculates the **average marks of an entire class** using an array.  
It is intended for beginners to practice **arrays**, **loops**, and **basic arithmetic operations** in JavaScript.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program stores the marks of students in an array and calculates the total marks by iterating over the array.  
The average is then computed by dividing the total marks by the number of students.

The final result is displayed in the browser console.

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Stores student marks in an array
- Uses a `for-of` loop to iterate through the array
- Calculates the sum of all marks
- Computes the average using array length
- Displays the average using `console.log()`

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Arrays in JavaScript
- `for-of` loop
- Arithmetic operations
- Array length property
- Console output using `console.log()`
