# Practice Question 2 – Student Grade Calculator

This repository contains a simple JavaScript program that assigns **grades to students based on their marks**.  
It is intended for beginners to practice **conditional statements** and **logical operators** in JavaScript.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program evaluates a student’s marks and assigns a grade according to the following criteria:

- 90–100 → Grade A  
- 70–89 → Grade B  
- 60–69 → Grade C  
- 50–59 → Grade D  
- 0–49 → Grade F  

The result is displayed in the browser console.
