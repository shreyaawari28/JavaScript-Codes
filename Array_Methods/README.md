# Practice Question – Array Methods (forEach, filter, reduce)

This repository contains a JavaScript program that demonstrates the use of important **array methods**: `forEach()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.  
It is intended for beginners to understand how arrays can be processed efficiently using built-in JavaScript methods.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program explains how different array methods work and when to use them:

- `forEach()` is used to iterate over each element of an array
- `filter()` is used to create a new array based on a condition
- `reduce()` is used to reduce an array to a single value

These methods help write cleaner and more readable code compared to traditional loops.

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Uses `forEach()` to perform an operation on each array element
- Uses `filter()` to select elements that satisfy a condition
- Uses `reduce()` to accumulate array values into a single result
- Demonstrates functional programming style in JavaScript
