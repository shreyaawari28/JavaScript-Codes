# Practice Question – Filter Marks Greater Than 90

This repository contains a simple JavaScript program that uses the **`filter()` array method** to extract marks of students who scored **90 and above**.  
It is intended for beginners to understand how filtering works in JavaScript arrays.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program stores marks of students in an array and filters out only those marks that are greater than 90.

The filtering logic is implemented using the `filter()` method with a callback function that checks the required condition.

The filtered result is displayed in the browser console.
