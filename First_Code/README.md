# First JS Code

## 📌 Overview
**First JS Code** is a basic JavaScript program created to understand how JavaScript works in a web browser.

In this program, I learned how to **connect an external JavaScript file with an HTML file**, how JavaScript is **executed inside the browser**, and how to **view output using the browser’s developer console**.

The project consists of a simple HTML file that loads a JavaScript file using the `<script>` tag.  
The JavaScript code uses `console.log()` to print messages, which helps confirm that the code is running correctly.

This project helped me understand the **importance of JavaScript in web development** and the basic workflow of running JavaScript through HTML.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how JavaScript runs in a web browser  
- Learn how to connect HTML and JavaScript files  
- Learn how to open and use the browser console  
- Execute and verify JavaScript code using `console.log()`

## 🧠 What I Learned
- JavaScript requires a runtime (browser) to execute  
- HTML is used to load JavaScript files  
- The `<script>` tag connects HTML and JavaScript  
- The browser console is essential for debugging  
- `console.log()` is a basic but powerful debugging tool

## 🧪 How It Works
- The browser opens the HTML file  
- The `<script src="first.js"></script>` tag loads the JavaScript file  
- The JavaScript code executes automatically  
- Output is displayed in the browser console

## 🖥️ Output
The output is displayed in the browser console after opening the HTML file.
