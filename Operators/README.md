# JavaScript Operators – Practice Program

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **practice implementation of JavaScript operators**, created using **HTML and JavaScript**.

In this program, I explored and demonstrated the usage of **different types of operators in JavaScript** by performing operations on numeric variables and printing the results to the browser console.

The focus of this project is to clearly understand **how operators work internally**, especially unary, comparison, and logical operators.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand different categories of JavaScript operators  
- Practice arithmetic operations using JavaScript  
- Learn the difference between pre and post increment/decrement  
- Understand assignment operators  
- Compare values using comparison operators  
- Apply logical operators on boolean conditions  

---

## 🧠 Operators Covered
- **Arithmetic Operators** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`)  
- **Unary Operators** (`++`, `--` – pre and post)  
- **Assignment Operators** (`=`, `+=`, `-=`)  
- **Comparison Operators** (`==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`)  
- **Logical Operators** (`&&`, `||`, `!`)  

---

## 🧪 How It Works
- Two variables `a` and `b` are initialized with numeric values  
- Different operators are applied to these variables  
- Results are displayed using `console.log()`  
- Logical operators are demonstrated using boolean conditions  

All output can be viewed directly in the **browser console**.

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Output is visible only in the browser console  
- No user input is taken  
- Program is meant purely for concept understanding
