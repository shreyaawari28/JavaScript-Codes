# JavaScript Operators – Example Program

This repository contains a basic JavaScript program that demonstrates the usage of **different types of operators** in JavaScript.  
It is intended for beginners who are learning JavaScript fundamentals and want to understand how operators work in real code.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program demonstrates the use of various JavaScript operators, including:

- Assignment operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Unary operators
- Assignment compound operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators

It also shows how operator results change based on **operand values** and **operator behavior**.

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Declares numeric variables using `let`
- Assigns initial values using the assignment operator (`=`)
- Performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation
- Demonstrates unary operators like pre-increment, post-increment, pre-decrement, and post-decrement
- Uses compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`)
- Compares values using comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`)
- Applies logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) on boolean expressions
- Prints all outputs to the browser console using `console.log()`

---

## 🧠 Operators Covered

- **Assignment Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`
- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`
- **Unary Operators**: `++`, `--`
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`

## 🖥️ Output

The output is displayed in the **browser console**.
