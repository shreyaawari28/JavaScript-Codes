# Practice Question 4 – Number Guessing Game

This repository contains a simple JavaScript program that implements a **number guessing game**.  
It is intended for beginners to practice **loops**, **conditional statements**, and **user interaction** using JavaScript.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program starts with a predefined game number.  
The user is asked to guess the number using `prompt()` until the correct number is entered.

If the user enters a wrong number, the program keeps asking the user to guess again.  
Once the correct number is guessed, a success message is displayed using an alert.

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Stores a fixed game number
- Takes user input using `prompt()`
- Compares user input with the game number
- Uses `if-else` to check the first guess
- Uses a `while` loop to keep asking until the correct guess
- Displays success messages using `alert()`

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- User input using `prompt()`
- Comparison operators
- `if-else` conditional statement
- `while` loop
- Boolean conditions
- Alerts for user feedback
